 			<strong class="side">Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus </strong>
			<br />
			Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your
			<br /> national and local public health authority. COVID-19 is still affecting mostly people in China with some
			outbreaks in<br />other countries. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover, but it
			can be more severe for<br />others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:
		</div>

		<div id="awaree">
			<strong class="side">Wash your hands frequently </strong>
			<br />
			Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
			<br />

			Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on
			your hands.
		</div>
		<img class="centi" src="images/handwahing.jpg" title="Wash your hands frequently"/>

		<div id="awareee"><strong class="side">Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</strong><br />
		Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus
			to your eyes, nose or mouth.<br /> From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

		</div>

		<img class="eyee" src="images/like.jpeg" title="Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth"/>

		<div id="respiratory"><strong class="side">Practice respiratory hygiene</strong><br/>
			Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means
			covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow <br/> or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
			Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

			Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene
			<br/>you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.<br/>

			If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early
			Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing,<br/> seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

			<br/>Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area.<br/> Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. <br/>This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</div>

			<img class="cov" src="images/cover.jpg" title="Practice respiratory hygiene"/>

			<div id="informed">
				<strong class="side">Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider</strong><br/>
				Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider,
				your <br/>national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others
				from COVID-19.<br/>

			Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is
				spreading in<br/> your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing
				to protect themselves.</div>

			<p class="other">Others Include:</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
				<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
